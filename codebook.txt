This is the codebook describing each of the columns in the submitted_dataset.csv file

The first two columns are straightforward:

activity
        The types of activity performed in the study

subject
        The ID number for the subject performing the activities

For the remaining columns, the following processes was applied:
        The data was initially collected on a 50Hz basis, and was averaged into a 20Hz basis.
        This means a reduction of data points from 50 points per sec to 20.
        "Point" is where there original scores were averaged (the  mean was taken as a point)
        "Dev" is the standard deviation of those different measurement scores that were averaged out.
        The range of these variables are from -1 to 1

        This dataset, however, contains the AGGREGATED values only.
        The measurements were aggregated for each activity and each subject.
        The aggregation method applied was the mean. 
        So each row in the dataset contains MEAN body linear and angular measurements, for each subject and each activity.
